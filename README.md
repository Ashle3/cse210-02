Through groupwork, we create a game called Hilo.


TODO:
Create a player class
    - player starts with 300 points
Create a card class
    - random card from ints 1-13




player.score += 100 if correct
player.score -= 75 if inccorect

at end of each "turn" check_points to see if game is over
if they have more than 0, ask if they want to continue game. (while loop)




(Establish a new player with attributes (points)
print current card (random int from 1-13)
 ask for higher/lower input
 get next card value and print
 correct_guess indicates if it was right or wrong
 verify points
 play again? )




 IDEAS:
 could make a shuffle function to reset the cards class after x amount of draws.
 Add a second or thrid player to the game
 Validate input (easy)
 Give each player a name attribute
